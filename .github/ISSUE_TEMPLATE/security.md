## STOP — Do Not File Security Bugs Here

Public GitHub issues are **not** the place for security vulnerabilities.

If you have found a bug related to:

- Smart contracts (EVM or Terra)
- Bridge operator logic
- Canceler / watchtower logic
- Fund safety or token handling
- Private key exposure
- Transaction replay or manipulation

**Report it privately** by direct message to the project maintainer.

Never include exploit details, vulnerable code paths, or reproduction steps in a public issue.

If this is a **frontend-only** bug (UI glitch, styling, wallet UX) with no security
implications, close this and use the **Frontend Bug Report** template instead.
