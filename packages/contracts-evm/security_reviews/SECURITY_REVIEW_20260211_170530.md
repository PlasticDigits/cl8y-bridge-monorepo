## Executive Summary

This document provides a full security review of the contracts-evm package in its current state. The bridge implements a cross-chain asset transfer system with user-initiated withdrawals, operator approvals, and a canceler role for withdrawal cancellation within a time window.

### Remediation Status (since prior review 20260211_154050)

| Finding | Status |
|---------|--------|
| RBAC deviation (operators had admin privileges) | ✅ Fixed – Fee/chain/token config now `onlyOwner` |
| `depositNative` when wrappedNative not set | ✅ Fixed – Reverts with `WrappedNativeNotSet` |
| Cancel window boundary documentation | ✅ Fixed – OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §3 documents exclusive boundary |
| withdrawExecute* caller responsibility | ✅ Documented – Integrators must call correct function per token type |

### Key Findings Summary (current state)

| Severity | Count | Summary |
|----------|-------|---------|
| High | 0 | — |
| Medium | 0 | — |
| Low/Info | 4 | Operational notes, integrator requirements |

## 1. Test Coverage

### 1.1 Coverage Overview

- **Total test suites:** 16
- **Total tests:** 317 passing (includes 4 invariant tests)
- **Bridge tests:** Verified via Bridge.t.sol and Bridge.inv.t.sol
- **Bridge invariants:** 4 (depositNonce, thisChainId, cancelWindow, registries)

### 1.2 Per-Contract Test Status

| Contract | Tests | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Bridge | ~41 | ✅ Excellent |
| ChainRegistry | ~18 | ✅ Good |
| TokenRegistry | 14 | ✅ Good |
| LockUnlock | 8 | ✅ Adequate |
| MintBurn | 7 | ✅ Adequate |
| GuardBridge | 9 | ✅ Good |
| BlacklistBasic | 7 | ✅ Adequate |
| TokenRateLimit | 11 | ✅ Good |
| HashLib | 38 | ✅ Excellent |
| FeeCalculatorLib | 32 | ✅ Good |
| BridgeInvariantTest | 4 | ✅ Implemented |
| Others | Various | ✅ Adequate |

### 1.3 Test Coverage Gaps

1. **Guard–Bridge integration** – Documented in OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §6. GuardBridge is tested in isolation; integration with the main Bridge is optional.
2. **Create3Deployer** – TODO for future (OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §7). Standard Solady CREATE3 wrapper.
3. **depositNative** – Full validation tests exist (wrappedNative not set, token not registered, dest mapping not set).

## 2. Top Common Solidity Issues

### 2.1 Reentrancy ✅

- **Bridge:** Uses `ReentrancyGuard` and `nonReentrant` on all deposit/withdraw entry points.
- **LockUnlock / MintBurn:** Use `ReentrancyGuard` on `lock`, `unlock`, `burn`, `mint`.
- **ETH transfers:** Fee and `operatorGas` transfers occur after state updates; `nonReentrant` prevents reentrancy.

**Verdict:** Reentrancy protections are in place.

### 2.2 Integer Overflow / Underflow ✅

- Solidity `^0.8.30` provides built-in checks.
- `unchecked` blocks in AccessManagerEnumerable are confined to loop counters and safe iterator patterns.
- No unsafe `unchecked` in critical Bridge/LockUnlock/MintBurn paths.

**Verdict:** No issues identified.

### 2.3 Access Control ✅

- **Admin (onlyOwner):** `pause`, `unpause`, `setCancelWindow`, `addOperator`, `removeOperator`, `addCanceler`, `removeCanceler`, `setFeeParams`, `setCustomAccountFee`, `removeCustomAccountFee`, upgrades. Chain/token registration in registries. `wrappedNative` is set at deployment in `initialize()` only.
- **Operator (onlyOperator):** `withdrawApprove`, `withdrawUncancel` only.
- **Canceler (onlyCanceler):** `withdrawCancel` only.
- **Public:** `deposit*`, `withdrawSubmit`, `withdrawExecute*`.

**Verdict:** RBAC aligns with the design.

### 2.4 Unchecked Low-Level Calls ✅

- Fee and `operatorGas` transfers use `call` with `require(success)`.
- GuardBridge `execute` uses `call` with `require(success)` and is `restricted`.
- External value transfers are guarded.

**Verdict:** No issues identified.

### 2.5 Front-Running ✅

- `withdrawSubmit` and `withdrawExecute*` are permissionless by design; recipient is derived from `destAccount`.
- No vulnerability from front-running identified.

### 2.6 Token Assumptions ✅ Documented

- **Rebasing / fee-on-transfer:** Not supported; LockUnlock/MintBurn balance checks document this.
- **Status:** Documented in OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §4.

## 3. Flows

### 3.1 Deposit Flow

1. **depositERC20 / depositERC20Mintable**
   - Validates token and chain; calculates fee; locks or burns; stores deposit record; emits event.

2. **depositNative**
   - Reverts if `wrappedNative == address(0)`.
   - Reverts if `wrappedNative` is not registered (`TokenNotRegistered`).
   - Reverts if dest mapping for `wrappedNative` and `destChain` is not set (`DestTokenMappingNotSet`).
   - Validates amount, chain; transfers fee to feeRecipient; Bridge retains net ETH; records deposit with `token: wrappedNative`.

### 3.2 Withdraw Flow

1. **withdrawSubmit** (public) – Creates `PendingWithdraw`.
2. **withdrawApprove** (operator) – Marks approved, pays `operatorGas`.
3. **withdrawCancel** (canceler) – Cancels within window.
4. **withdrawUncancel** (operator) – Restores and restarts window.
5. **withdrawExecuteUnlock / withdrawExecuteMint** (public) – Executes after window (exclusive boundary).

### 3.3 Hash Consistency

- `HashLib.computeXchainHashId` used consistently on deposit and withdraw.
- Correct alignment for cross-chain matching (srcChain, destChain, srcAccount, destAccount, token, amount, nonce).

## 4. Access Control (RBAC)

### 4.1 Current Implementation

#### Bridge

| Function | Access | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `pause`, `unpause` | onlyOwner | ✅ |
| `setCancelWindow` | onlyOwner | ✅ |
| `addOperator`, `removeOperator` | onlyOwner | ✅ |
| `addCanceler`, `removeCanceler` | onlyOwner | ✅ |
| `setFeeParams`, `setCustomAccountFee`, `removeCustomAccountFee` | onlyOwner | ✅ |
| `withdrawApprove`, `withdrawUncancel` | onlyOperator | ✅ |
| `withdrawCancel` | onlyCanceler | ✅ |
| `deposit*`, `withdrawSubmit`, `withdrawExecute*` | Public | ✅ |
| `upgradeToAndCall` | onlyOwner | ✅ |

#### ChainRegistry / TokenRegistry

- All registration and config: `onlyOwner`. No operators or cancelers.

### 4.2 Owner as Implicit Operator/Canceler

- `_onlyOperator` and `_onlyCanceler` both allow `msg.sender == owner()` in addition to their respective role mappings.
- This is intentional and documented: owner retains full control.

---

## 5. Additional Findings

### 5.1 Cancel Window Boundary ✅ Verified

**Location:** `Bridge.sol` `_validateWithdrawExecution`, OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §3

**Implementation:** `if (block.timestamp <= windowEnd) revert CancelWindowActive(windowEnd);`  
**Semantics:** Execution allowed when `block.timestamp > windowEnd` (exclusive). Documentation matches implementation.

### 5.2 Fee Recipient Must Accept ETH (Low) ✅ Documented

**Location:** `Bridge.sol` – `depositNative`, `setFeeParams`

**Status:** Documented in OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §1. `feeRecipient` must accept plain ETH (EOA or compatible contract).

### 5.3 Guard Module State Mutations (Low) ✅ Documented

**Location:** `TokenRateLimit.sol` – `checkDeposit`, `checkWithdraw`

**Status:** Documented in OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §2. Guard check functions may mutate state.

### 5.4 withdrawExecuteUnlock vs withdrawExecuteMint – Caller Responsibility (Info)

**Location:** `Bridge.sol` – `withdrawExecuteUnlock`, `withdrawExecuteMint`

**Observation:** The Bridge does not route based on token type. The caller must invoke the correct function for the token: `withdrawExecuteUnlock` for LockUnlock tokens, `withdrawExecuteMint` for MintBurn tokens. Calling the wrong function reverts (e.g., mint on non-mintable token).

**Status:** Document as integrator requirement. No security impact; UX concern for integrators.

### 5.5 depositNative: No Wrapping of ETH (Info)

**Location:** `Bridge.sol` – `depositNative`

**Observation:** The Bridge receives raw ETH and retains it in the contract. It does not wrap to WETH. The `wrappedNative` address is used as the token identifier in the deposit record for cross-chain matching. The Bridge's `receive()` accepts ETH; the net amount (after fee) stays in the Bridge. Off-chain infrastructure must coordinate mint/unlock of wrapped native on the destination chain.

**Status:** Design is consistent; no vulnerability identified. Documented implicitly in deposit flow.

### 5.6 Create3Deployer Coverage (Info)

**Observation:** `Create3Deployer` has minimal direct test coverage.

**Status:** Marked TODO in OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §7. Standard infrastructure; deployment script verification deferred.

---

## 6. Recommendations Summary

### Implemented (this review)

1. **withdrawExecute* routing** – ✅ Documented in OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §7.
2. **Guard–Bridge integration tests** – ✅ Documented in OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §8.
3. **depositNative / wrappedNative at deploy** – ✅ WETH address now provided in `Bridge.initialize()`. Removed `setWrappedNative`; `wrappedNative` is set at deployment only. Deploy scripts pass `WETH_ADDRESS` (Deploy.s.sol) or deploy WETH (DeployLocal.s.sol).

### Informational

4. **Create3Deployer** – TODO for future (OPERATIONAL_NOTES.md §10).
